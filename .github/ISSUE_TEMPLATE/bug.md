name: Bug report
about: If something is definitely wrong in the bridge (rather than just a setup issue),
  file a bug report. Remember to include relevant logs. If you aren't sure what's needed,
  ask in the Matrix room rather than opening an incomplete issue. Issues with insufficient
  detail will likely just be ignored.
